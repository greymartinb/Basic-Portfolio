		<p> First of all, thanks for the interest. But for the most part you will be profoundly bored by my story. Relevant facts, I certified through the UT Bootcamp Coding class with top marks. As a result of that the last 60 days of my life have been spent inside. As an unfortunate side effect I find that light burns now. But on the plus side I am a Web Development Guru. In addition to that you should hire me for three other reasons: </p>

			<ol>
				<li> I can grab things from the top shelf, always, which adds a verticality to all office storage. </li>
				<li> I am a smoker, so the odds I will ever draw additionally funds in retirement are slim. </li>
				<li> Again, because I am a smoker in a Belko Experiment situation I am not a threat </li>
			</ol>
